Text = 1, 1, Welcome to the ATGM range. Today's mission is to practice using the Hellfire ATGM. There are two platoons of tanks and a BMP platoon. All three are shown on the map at the left. These platoons are targets and will not fire back. Approach each platoon using available cover and destroy all the vehicles using your hellfire ATGMs. Once the mission begins, press the [N] key to go to the map screen and plot waypoints to your targets.

Heading = 9, Objectives
Map = images\tmap2.pcx
Text = 1, 1, Seek out and destroy the tank platoons first. Once they have been destroyed approach the BMP platoon and destroy it. You do not have enough Hellfires to destroy all the vehicles, once your Hellfires have been depleted use your chaingun to destroy the remaining vehicles. This is a good opportunity to learn to control the Helicopter from the gunner's seat. Try to engage at least one of the platoons from the gunner's seat.
