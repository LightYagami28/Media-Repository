Text = 1, 1, The situation is extremely fluid. Most of the divisions facing V Corps have ceased to exist as a combat unit. The exception is the 10th Guards Tank. 1st and 3rd Cavalry are forming a pocket which should trap most of the Central Group of Forces, or those that are left. 3rd US Infantry is responsible for squeezing the pocket tight.
