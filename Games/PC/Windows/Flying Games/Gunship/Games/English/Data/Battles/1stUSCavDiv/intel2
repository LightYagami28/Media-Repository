Text = 1, 1, 1st Cavalry has started its first offensive against the Russians. The line will now hopefully stabilize long enough for continued offensives against the 3rd Shock Army. As it stands, 1st Cavalry is starting to move north to prevent being flanked by the 7th and 10th Guards leaving 3rd Infantry to deal with the 47th Guards Tank and the 27th Motor Rifle.
