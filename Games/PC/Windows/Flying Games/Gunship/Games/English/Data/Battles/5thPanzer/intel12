Heading = 9, II Corps SECTOR
Map = images\cs4.pcx
Text = 1, 1, The situation is extremely fluid. Most of the divisions facing II Corps have ceased to exist as a combat unit. The exception is the 7th MRD in Gorodok. We need the airfield outside the city, so 5th Panzer is launching an offensive to take it. \n V and III Corps are forming a pocket which should trap most of the Central Group of Forces, or those that are left. II Corps is responsible for squeezing the pocket tight.
