Heading = 9, CYCLIC
Map = images\back.pcx
Text = 1, 1, Flight Hints: \n Generally, pushing the stick forward does not cause the helicopter to dive. If you push it all the way forward and hold it, you will start to dive only when you reach maximum power. You will also gain speed. \n Pulling the stick back does not mean you will climb. A common mistake is to pull back on the cyclic when you want to climb, instead you will end up flying backwards!

You will begin to fly in the direction you are facing. \n \n Use the CYCLIC either alone or with the tail rotor if you wish to turn like an airplane.
