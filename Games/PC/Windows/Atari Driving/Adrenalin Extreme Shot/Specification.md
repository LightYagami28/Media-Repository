The reason why the `data2.cab` and `data3.cab` files are not included in this repository is due to GitHub's file size limitations. GitHub restricts file uploads to a maximum size of 100 MB per file, and these particular files exceed that limit. As a result, they cannot be stored directly in the repository. To resolve this, the missing files are made available through the provided Telegram channels, which allows for their download and inclusion in the installation.
