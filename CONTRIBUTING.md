### Naming Conventions
To ensure consistency and improve the repository’s structure, please follow these guidelines when naming files and directories:
- Use **lowercase letters** and hyphens (`-`) for file and folder names.
- For albums, games, or movies, include the **year of release** (e.g., `game-title-2005`).
- For games and albums, include the **platform** (e.g., `game-title-pc` or `album-title-artist`).

### Metadata
Whenever possible, include the following metadata for each entry in a new file:
- For **games**: platform, developer, publisher, genre, release year.
- For **movies**: genre, director, release year, cast.
- For **music**: artist, album name, genre, release year.

This metadata helps to organize and categorize the content efficiently.
